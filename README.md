# Member Tracker

A local networking group could use something a little more sophisticated than their mailing list to track their member info so I built a  CRUD app that I think would be of some help. Functionality includes adding/editing/deleting members & chapters as well as searching for members by chapter, tenure, whether or not they are a volunteer, or a combination of the three. I used the Play Java framework, Hibernate, MySQL, MariaDB, jQuery, Scala, and HTML/CSS.
